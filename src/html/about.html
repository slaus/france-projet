            <p>There are a couple of reasons why employers ask this question in interviews.</p>
            <p>The first reason is they want to make sure you did some research before applying. They don’t want someone
                who’s applying to 200 positions per day without even looking or caring what type of job they get.</p>
            <p>Why? Well, employers want someone who will be motivated and work hard in their job. And they figure if
                you have thought about your job search and have specific reasons for applying, then you’re more likely
                to really like their job.</p>
            <p>Whereas, if you’re just applying randomly to as many jobs as you can find online, there’s a greater
                chance you won’t like their job… which means you might leave, lose motivation, etc.</p>
            <p>That’s how employers see it.</p>
